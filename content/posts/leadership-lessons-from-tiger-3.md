I really hit the jackpot when I accidentally found myself sitting at the screening of `Tiger 3` (donâ€™t ask me how). I was fascinated (read overwhelmed) by the turn of events that my brain went bonkers seeing so many amazing Leadership lessons **(or lack thereof)** that I thought are too precious to just keep to myself and the entire world should know.

This is not a spoiler (although you might get to know a few bits here and there), but it's by no means a replacement of the movie in itself, as my words or any words canâ€™t do justice to what happens on screen.

> Nobody, not even Director's father, understands it completely.

This story begins and revolves around two orgs (teams to be simple) â€“ `RAW` and `ISI` in a large company called `World Peace`

`RAW` has `Tiger` (Salman Khan) and ISI has `Zoya` (Katrina Kaif). I donâ€™t know about the actual positions, but these two are at Lead (Senior+ Engineer) positions that have high visibility and are leading key projects.

`RAW` and `ISI` are solving similar problem statements and need some collaboration. In this instance `Tiger` needs some info from `Zoya` but heâ€™s unable to get a satisfactory response. He tries to get the _project execution status_ and details multiple times but always gets a canned response â€“ weâ€™re on track, itâ€™ll be shipped in time and everythingâ€™s good.

`Tiger` being a diligent employee doesnâ€™t just sit back at his desk and takes matters into his own hands. He starts literally tailing engineers of the other team (ISI, `Zoya`) and begins confronting/spying instead of going via proper channels. After wasting a ton of time he finds out that `Zoya`â€™s team is doing the exact opposite of what he was thinking and gets into a direct conflict with her.

<div class="message-box">
  
- _What went well?_
  - `Tiger` pushed hard and didnâ€™t get complacent
- _What went wrong?_
  - Lots of time wasted at both ends
  - `Zoya` chasing wrong goals, not at all whatâ€™s needed by her stakeholder, `Tiger`
  - No communication at all, no Jira updates, or e-mails
  - `Zoya` doesnâ€™t believe in delegation and tries to do everything herself, _will be a growth area for her next promotion_

</div>
 
>  ### Lesson â€“ Essence of keeping Project status real.
>> Keep project status updates real and share the report with stakeholders at regular cadence to avoid last minute surprises. Avoid getting into meetings (or stalk) 1:1 just for status updates â€“ huge waste of everyoneâ€™s time.

Later in the movie, another important moment comes when `Tiger` & `Zoya` have to choose between two projects as mentioned below

| Project summary                                                                                   | Complexity | Success probability                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Steal something (details not available) from an ultra high secure establishment (illegal pro max) | Super high | Negative, not even 0                  |
| Find a not-so-common drug                                                                         | Medium     | High (given the skillset of the team) |

At this time, the team rejects all conventional wisdom and decides to go with Option 1, I mean, can you believe it? Yes, me neither ðŸ¤¦

Needless to say the result was disastrous; led to astronomical losses for everyone and a multi-level escalation sending the entire organisation into a tizzy. It disrupted existing projects and caused huge stress for other employees too.

<div class="message-box">
  
- _What went well?_
  - Project commitment meeting where Leadership was assured that the work will be done before Go Live date
- _What went wrong?_
  - Absolutely everything

</div>

> ### Lesson â€“ Strategy and plan review are key for success.
>
> > Never go into execution before carefully evaluating all possible options in the Design (HLD) review. Have a thorough review process for critical projects by Leadership (Bosses of `Zoya` & `Tiger`)

As you can expect, the Tech Leads made commitments without even thinking who will actually do the work and then ran helter-skelter for hiring the team. They beguiled 5 new hires into joining them by promising challenging work (which was actually true) and the opportunity to learn and get mentored by legends (of course)

<div class="message-box">
  
- _What went well?_
  - Hit hiring target of the company, 5 new hires
- _What went wrong?_
  - Everything for the new hires (3 joinees even got sacked for life, RIP)

</div>

> ### Lesson â€“ Integrity & transparency is the foundation of good Leadership.
>
> > Leadership lacked integrity; Tech Leads exploited their reputation, using it to manipulate and coerce interview candidates through power games. Never hire candidates under false pretences which would prove detrimental for their future. Candidates should also do their due diligence before accepting the role

After the teams induct new hires, the project execution begins, things go awry soon and the Tech Leads find themselves in a helpless state needing immediate help. The organisation has no other option but to rope in an external consultant (`Shahrukh` as `Pathaan`) to help in overcoming this roadblock to meet promised deadline

<div class="message-box">
  
- _What went well?_
  - Consultant was able to unblock the team in the short term
- _What went wrong?_
  - Increased project cost because of last minute hire of an external consultant
  - Major re-arch & re-work because the Consultant didnâ€™t understand the problem and the existing architecture completely

</div>

> ### Lesson â€“ Careful with external help in the middle of a high-stakes project.
>
> > Always review the project quote/plan given by expert external consultants as their solution might not always be best for the long run of the project or solve all edge cases

Final act was a mega major project where both teams (with considerable head-count) were working together against a common goal (read enemy `Emraan Hashmi`). This project was anything but smooth. One moment it would appear `on track` and the next it would be in `grave red`, almost like a sine wave which is never a good thing for a companyâ€™s report card.

<div class="message-box">
  
- _What went well?_
  - The project was delivered meeting the exit criteria
- _What went wrong?_
  - Project was executed in a totally random manner
  - No blueprint, plan existed
  - Huge army of people hired with sub-par skills â€“ they fired so many dead bullets, not one hit the target (enemy)
  - A culture of total chaos; toxic work environment
  - Leaders werenâ€™t meeting with each other 1:1 and were communicating major decisions directly in all-hands

</div>

> ### Lesson â€“ Culture and alignment form the bedrock of Leadership and defines future successes or failures.
>
> > A project of this magnitude was undertaken without Leadership buy-in and alignment was sought between stakeholders as the project was being executed. Bad hiring where people were hired in huge numbers without a proper interview process which took the entire team down. Toxic culture where Women in Leadership donâ€™t recognise Women for equal work â€“ classic case of Gender Inequality. `Tiger` got the entire credit at the end and `Zoya` wasnâ€™t mentioned at all by the Pakistani PM ðŸ˜­

Apart from these contextual leadership lessons, there were some uber level lessons we can learn.

> ### Lesson â€“ Donâ€™t celebrate early and avoid Hero culture.
>
> > Leads celebrated victories prematurely, overlooked crucial details, displayed a casual approach, and later had to retract. The entire organisation was built around a Hero-worshipping culture which made the environment toxic and non-scalable. No precedent of knowledge transfer, mentorship or documentation. Hence huge dependency on a few shoulders.

Hope you enjoyed the Leadership lessons as much as the movie if not more ðŸ˜œ
