it's almost may and in just about a month a brand new quarter would start which comes with a possibility of endless opportunities in engg roadmap parlance. 

we've come a long way from knowing what would get done years in advance, like a construction building, say a new mall. once the blueprint is finalised, you can usually estimate the multi-year work upfront at least on paper before you dive deep into execution. but who knew building software is even tougher or have we deliberately made it that way?

we work in sprints, we put our heads down for two weeks and then again and again. some teams decide within these two weeks what next to do and sort of groom their stories with no hints or indication of what lies ahead and coins words like agile :P

but there's just too much flux in this way. there's so much extra time being spent deciding every two weeks what to do, whether something matters to us or can be pushed out?

in real world, work happens around big projects and launches. and they have dates or an expected date of launch. everything begins from there and you usually back calculate.

so with above context, if you're an engineering manager, how do you decide what gets done in a quarter but it's easier said than done; and no heroics will bail you out (coming from a hero himself :P)

since this work happens once in a while and only 4 times an year, it's easy to just go with the flow and not put a method or perfect the art. 

> because seriously who cares? 

**actually you should, as if your life depends on it**

i've done it both ways (just don't tell my boss though), planned roadmaps, sprints on the fly and derived them by using the below framework. the difference was monumental in the quality of deliverables and the morale of the team!

earlier i'd have a meeting every two weeks, rethinking priorities and not just me, my entire team. i thought having them on the call would give them visibility but all they saw was uncertainty and jitteriness. they felt as if nobody had any idea what exactly needed to be done, and everyone was busy pitching things they would like to do instead which might not be in the best interest of the organisation. like everyone can't work on reducing build times or trying out a new framework which came out yesterday!

so i had to change, and below is what i put together after i got humiliated at a party with my peers and bosses :P (no surprises there)

## 1. draft objectives & key results

who | ems and pms should deliberate and debate on the most important problems and get leadership buy-in. some orgs have yearly okrs published by the ceo/cto's office which can be translated into okrs at your level which is nothing but matching your efforts to meet the company goals
----|--------－
when | 40 days before quarter starts (q - 40) days
output | objectives & key results with impact

e.g. 
- objective: improve the conversion funnel by 20% on our e-commerce app
- key results:
  - reduce page load of product page from 6s → 3.5s
  - remove friction on payment page by showing up upi as the top payment mode
  - launch 1-click purchase from home to checkout for high value items like phones & appliances

## 2. come up with initiatives for each key result (break-up & scope)

who | staff+ engineers breakdown the key result into solid activities which can be done by 1 person in about 2 weeks. in short they define the scope and breakdown big problem statements into short palatable stories for the team

e.g.
