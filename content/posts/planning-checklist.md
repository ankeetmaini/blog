description: this post tries to add a method to madness which runs amok every 3 months and leaders run helter-skelter to put an exciting list of okrs together

it's almost may and in just about a month a brand new quarter would start which comes with a possibility of endless opportunities in engg roadmap parlance. 

we've come a long way from knowing what would get done years in advance, like a construction building, say a new mall. once the blueprint is finalised, you can usually estimate the multi-year work upfront at least on paper before you dive deep into execution. but who knew building software is even tougher or have we deliberately made it that way?

we work in sprints, we put our heads down for two weeks and then again and again. some teams decide within these two weeks what next to do and sort of groom their stories with no hints or indication of what lies ahead and coins words like agile :P

but there's just too much flux in this way. there's so much extra time being spent deciding every two weeks what to do, whether something matters to us or can be pushed out?

in real world, work happens around big projects and launches. and they have dates or an expected date of launch. everything begins from there and you usually back calculate.

so with above context, if you're an engineering manager, how do you decide what gets done in a quarter but it's easier said than done; and no heroics will bail you out (coming from a hero himself :P)

since this work happens once in a while and only 4 times an year, it's easy to just go with the flow and not put a method or perfect the art. 

> because seriously who cares? 

**actually you should, as if your life depends on it**

i've done it both ways (just don't tell my boss though), planned roadmaps, sprints on the fly and derived them by using the below framework. the difference was monumental in the quality of deliverables and the morale of the team!

earlier i'd have a meeting every two weeks, rethinking priorities and not just me, my entire team. i thought having them on the call would give them visibility but all they saw was uncertainty and jitteriness. they felt as if nobody had any idea what exactly needed to be done, and everyone was busy pitching things they would like to do instead which might not be in the best interest of the organisation. like everyone can't work on reducing build times or trying out a new framework which came out yesterday!

so i had to change, and below is what i put together after i got humiliated at a party with my peers and bosses :P (no surprises there)

## 1. draft objectives & key results

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>who</td>
    <td>ems and pms should deliberate and debate on the most important problems and get leadership buy-in.<br><br>some orgs have yearly okrs published by the ceo/cto's office which can be translated into okrs at your level which is nothing but matching your efforts to meet the company goals</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>when</td>
    <td>40 days before quarter starts (q - 40 days)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>output</td>
    <td>objectives &amp; key results with impact</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

e.g. 
- objective: improve the conversion funnel by 20% on our e-commerce app
- key results:
  - reduce page load of product page from 6s â†’ 3.5s
  - remove friction on payment page by showing up upi as the top payment mode
  - launch 1-click purchase from home to checkout for high value items like phones & appliances

## 2. come up with initiatives for each key result (break-up & scope)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>who</td>
    <td>staff+ engineers breakdown the key result into solid activities which can be done by 1 person in about 2 weeks. <br><br>in short they define the scope and breakdown big problem statements into short palatable stories for the team</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>when</td>
    <td>a month before the quarter start (q - 30 days)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>output</td>
    <td>breakdown and scope definition of activities/tasks with t-shirt size (broad) estimates</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


e.g.
- key result: reduce page load of product page from 6s â†’ 3.5s
- initiatives
  - reduce the javascript bundle size by 120kb to improve time to interactive
    - remove lodash
    - write a lighter implementation for the product page image component which is 100kb in size
  - ðŸ”º enable edge caching for product listing to speed up the api response time
  - ðŸ”º partial painting of product page reusing the state of homepage while the api call is in progress

> ðŸ”º means that the initiative needs refinement and is a fuzzy item. it will usually reqire an hld/lld/1-pager and would probably get executed as a spike item where concrete details would become clear after a deep-dive or a small poc.
>> the staff+ engineers would also have to make a case as to why do they think the above initiative is needed with roi in mind as well because such fuzzy initiatives require greater engineering efforts and often run into risk during execution

## 3. prepare plan with sequencing, owners and known risks

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>who</td>
    <td>tech leads and ems define the sequencing in a gantt chart to see what's landing when and if there's a scope for parallelisation. <br><br>they also define the owners for each initiative and list down risks which needs to be under close watch</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>when</td>
    <td>2 weeks before quarter start (q - 15 days)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>output</td>
    <td>gantt chart, owners & risk table</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

tech leads & ems create a gantt chart like below at this point to see how much work is possible taking into account the t-shirt size estimations

*quick reference to t-shirt sizing & project recommendations*
| ðŸ‘• | estimate in person weeks | notes
s | 2 person weeks | can be lead & delivered by sde1/2
m | 4 person weeks | needs at least a senior engineer to see it through
l | 8 person weeks | needs a staff engineer to lead and constant architecture reviews
xl | 16 person weeks | multi-quarter effort and needs a staff+ engineer to lead & deliver
xxl | 20+ person weeks | multi-quarter effort and needs an architect to lead and breakdown
