# why cypress?

- runs in the browser <Text>(unlike Selenium)</Text>
- inherent support for debugging (preserves DOM states)
- uses JavaScript as the only language
- inherently waits for the elements
- no <Text>thread.sleep()</Text> or magic <Text>waitUntill()</Text> in your code
- not all flaky! and HUGEEE community!

---

# why detox?

- <Text>gray box testing</Text> - uses espresso internally
- in-built react-native support
- no explicit wait needed
- Provides JavaScript as the first class interface
- very active community support
