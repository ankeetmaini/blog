I hope you've gone through the first part of this series (if not I've linked it in the next line) and are warmed up now for making updates to your documents with surgical precision.

> [Part 1 - Going deeper into MongoDB](/posts/mongo-intro/)

I'll try out the various update statements on a local MongoDB instance using Docker, please [refer this](<(/posts/mongo-intro/#trying-it-and-installing)>) if you want to follow along.

## ~~C~~RUD is the new CRUD; C = U

Remember I told you [how to create documents](/posts/mongo-intro/#create) in the previous part. You can use it but as you'll see in MongoDB we can use `update` to do `create` too.

This is awesome for two reasons

- one less API to ~~Google~~ remember
- we mostly write code to create/update in the same function/component etc, this way we don't need to guess or make an extra call to find out which one to use

## How do I create/update a document?

I want to save a document as shown below.

```json
{ "name": "Samosa", "type": "spicy" }
```

Using the knowledge of the previous post, we know that all the functions of Mongo take a filter object as its first argument.

```js
db.food.updateOne(filter, updateObject, config);
```

At this point no records exist in the db, so the filter will lead to 0 results, but since we've used a special attribute in config `upsert: true` a document would be created. If you omit this, then the `updateOne` call won't save the doc if it did not exist.

> So for the last time, `upsert: true` is what gives `updateOne` the power to _create_.

```js
db.food.updateOne(
  { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
  { $set: { name: "Samosa", type: "spicy" } }, // update doc
  { upsert: true } // config
);
```

I know you see a weird `$set` keyword in the above command.

> That's an atomic update operator. There're a few of them, not many and they are our friends. I'll also make a table at the end of the post for quick reference. I'm so helpful, I know right!

Running this on the shell...

```bash
> db.food.updateOne(
      { name: "Samosa" },
      { $set: { name: "Samosa", type: "spicy" } },
      { upsert: true }
    );
{
	"acknowledged" : true,
	"matchedCount" : 0,
	"modifiedCount" : 0,
	"upsertedId" : ObjectId("5fec78c3cbb7cf98a4358bf4")
}
> db.food.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fec78c3cbb7cf98a4358bf4"), "name" : "Samosa", "type" : "spicy" }
```

So `$set` really sets ðŸ˜‰

## How can I increment a count value?

So using the above example I want to keep a track of how many `Samosa`s I ate.

We can do this by

- first filtering the food === samosa
- adding a new attribute for keeping the count (say `count`)
- and incrementing it

Doing the above with code

```js
db.food.updateOne(
  { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
  { $inc: { count: -1000 } }, // update keys
  { upsert: true } // config
);
```

I know you'd be judging me for using `upsert: true` here which is not needed, but that's the beauty. You can use it and totally forget about handling if the document doesn't exist. This should become the default in your codebase.

Running this on shell...

```bash
> db.food.updateOne(
...   { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
...   { $inc: { count: 1 } }, // update keys
...   { upsert: true } // config
... );
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
> db.food.updateOne(
...   { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
...   { $inc: { count: 1 } }, // update keys
...   { upsert: true } // config
... );
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
> db.food.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fec8174cbb7cf98a4358c40"), "name" : "Samosa", "type" : "spicy", "count" : 2 }
>
```

Needless to say if you did it twice it will increment twice. The value `count: 1` is a step value, if you gave 100, it'll increment by 100.

## How can I decrement a count value?

Sorry friends, there's no `$dec` modifier (lol), if you want to decrement use a negative step value

```js
db.food.updateOne(
  { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
  { $inc: { count: -1 } }, // update keys
  { upsert: true } // config
);
```

## How can I delete a key from the document?

Use `$unset`

I now want to delete the count attribute we added to the food document, because that's like the worst schema design; storing count without the user context.

```js
db.food.updateOne(
  { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
  { $unset: { count: 1 } }, // update keys
  { upsert: true } // config
);
```

Again, the value of `count` doesn't matter, `$unset` just removes the attribute.

```bash
> db.food.updateOne(
...   { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
...   { $unset: { count: 0 } }, // update keys
...   { upsert: true } // config
... );
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
> db.food.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fec8174cbb7cf98a4358c40"), "name" : "Samosa", "type" : "spicy" }
```

## How can I add items to an array which is an attribute in the doc?

Till now we're doing the edits at the root, but now let's see how can we edit parts which are located deep.

For example, this is how our doc looks like now(omitting the `_id` for brevity)

```json
{ "name": "Samosa", "type": "spicy" }
```

Imagine you're the owner of a restaurant that sells this item and hungry customers are placing orders. We want to store the `orders` now so that the document looks like the below json

```json
{
  "name": "Samosa",
  "type": "spicy",
  "orders": [
    { "customerName": "Ankeet", "quantity": 2 },
    { "customerName": "Romeo", "quantity": 5 }
  ]
}
```

Enter `$push`

```js
db.food.updateOne(
  { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
  {
    $push: {
      orders: { customerName: "Ankeet", quantity: 2 },
    },
  },
  { upsert: true }
);
```

This will not only add the attribute `orders` to the doc but also push the order to it.

If I were to run this in the shell

```bash
> db.food.updateOne(
...   { name: "Samosa" }, // filter
...   { $push: { orders: { customerName: "Ankeet", quantity: 2 } } },
...   { upsert: true }
... );
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
> db.food.find()
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5fec8174cbb7cf98a4358c40"),"name" : "Samosa",
    "type" : "spicy",
    "orders" : [
        { "customerName" : "Ankeet", "quantity" : 2 }
    ]
}
```
