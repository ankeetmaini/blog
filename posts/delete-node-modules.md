I routinely (almost every month) see my Mac's disk space getting filled notifications.

Mostly it's just `node_modules` eating your hard disk up. In the era of trying out stuff by `npm i` leaves a heavy residue on your system.

> Use `npx npkill`

This is an amazing CLI which shows you the space taken by each `node_modules` folder and can clean them up by hitting the `spacebar` key.

I forget this nifty `npm` module every time (hopefully not anymore :P)
