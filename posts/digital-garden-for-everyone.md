Note-taking is a highly underrated ability to preserve context over time. You might have heard about `RoamResearch` and `Foam` (which is similar but open source and lets you write notes, categorize them, link them all from inside `VSCode`).

> It also lets you publish them for easy viewing on a browser.

I recently went down this rabbit-hole to try and find the best setup for it. I liked the plain [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) but I wanted the published version to look like a Digital Garden. So I combined both of them :)

I've just published a template on Github which has an example and detailed instructions on the readme.

If you would like to checkout the published `notes` or your very own `digital-garden` then here you go [https://ankeetmaini.github.io/foam-digital-garden/](https://ankeetmaini.github.io/foam-digital-garden/)
