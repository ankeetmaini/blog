Note-taking is a highly underrated ability to preserve context over time. You might have heard about `RoamResearch` and `Foam` (which is similar but open source and lets you write notes, categorize them, link them all from inside `VSCode`).

> It also lets you publish them for easy viewing on a browser.

I recently went down this rabbit-hole to try and find the best setup for it. I liked the plain [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) but I wanted the published version to look like a Digital Garden.

> What's a digital garden?

Digital garden is a collection of notes, that get refined over time. You link your notes and thoughts via a theme, and everything is interconnected using bi-directional links to let you flow freely with the ideas. If you're a visual person then checkout the below preview which shows a garden in action or [click here](https://ankeetmaini.github.io/foam-digital-garden/).

So I combined both of them :)

I've just published a template on Github which has an example and detailed instructions on the readme.
