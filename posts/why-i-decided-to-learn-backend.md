## OMG, I know right!

This was my reaction too when I took this path. I've been a frontend engineer for as long as I can remember and I absolutely love it to the core.

When I started my career in 2010 and learnt a handful of functions of `jQuery` with which I could add, remove or animate stuff on the browser screen it almost felt like magic. I have never been more excited to work within the constraints of a browser, it feels home.

Last year I happened to work on projects which were infra heavy, and they introduced me to technologies like `Docker` and `Kubernetes` and in general how stuff should be architected for scalability. In the process I not only dockerised a lot of frontend apps but also a lot of backend side code mostly written in `Java`. Before this any language except `JavaScript` used to seem alien and my brain would give up even before trying. But now they don't feel so intimidating.

As an Engineer I want to say yes to most of the feature requests and love bringing delight to the users of my app but sometimes we need to work around because of constraints either from experience, timelines or backend api designs. 

Sometimes I am able to get what I want in terms of APIs but sometimes we've to make a compromises given the complexity involved in the API implementation, lack of data etc. There's very little I could do about it mostly because I'd not understand the nitty-gritty and I had to be limited only till the JSON structure but nothing beyond that.
