Hi! Today I'll go through the problem **asteroid collision** and solve it with you!

### problem

You're given an array of numbers, some positive and some negative. Each number signifies how big is the asteroid, bigger the absolute number bigger the size.

- positive numbers mean they move right ->
- negative numbers mean they move left <-

Asteroids moving towards each other will collide and the bigger one will win with smaller one being destroyed. If both are of the same size then both will get destroyed.

You need to return the asteroids that will be left after the collision ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

### concept

I'll use the two pointer approach. 

- left pointer
- right pointer

I'll keep on checking if the adjacent asteroids are colliding, and keep incrementing/decrementing the pointers till the entire array of asteroids are exhausted. This can be done either recursively or iteratively.

Let's see for input `[10, -4, -8, 7, 9]`, how the above approach works.

### code

Let's start by defining the pointers and the main loop as below.

```javascript
var asteroidCollision = function(asteroids) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = 1;
    
    const willCollide = () => {} // will return a boolean
    
    const adjustLeft = () => {} // TODO
    
    while (left < asteroids.length && right < asteroids.length) {
        const isColliding = willCollide();
        
        const absLeft = Math.abs(asteroids[left]);
        const absRight = Math.abs(asteroids[right]);
        
        if (isColliding) {
            if (absLeft > absRight) {
                asteroids[right] = null;
                right++;
            }
            
            if (absLeft < absRight) {
                asteroids[left] = null;
                adjustLeft();
            }
            
            if (absLeft === absRight) {
                asteroids[right] = null;
                asteroids[left] = null;
                right++;
                adjustLeft();
            }
        } else {
            // not colliding, simply move the pointers
            left = right;
            right++;
        }
    }
    
    return asteroids.filter(Boolean);
};
```

In the above solution, we've two pointers **left** and **right** starting at 0 and 1 respectively.

The main loop will go on till any of the pointers go outside the bound of input array. So far so cool.

#### algorithm

- on every loop, check if the asteroids present on left and right will collide or not. 
- I'll define the function `willCollide` in just a moment, but for now it returns a boolean
- simple case: if the asteroids don't collide, just move the pointers 
- and if the asteroids are colliding, there are three conditions that need to be handled
    - if left is bigger
        - then right one goes boom ðŸ’¥
        - move the right pointer further along
    - if the right is bigger
        - make the left one ðŸ’¥
        - adjust the left pointer (we'll come to this in just a min)
    - if both are of same size
        - both go boooom ðŸ’¥
        - move the right pointer and adjust left
- finally, ignore all the `null` values and return the remaining asteroids for the answer
